# Become a Tech Director
Here I am going to list what I consider it is required for an engineer to become Tech Director



## Hiring & developing team members career
- Hiring & retain talent
- Define Roles & responsibilities
	- https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/roles-and-responsibilities
- Metrics for People
	- Performance metrics
- How to champion Engineering with product owners
## Agility
- Scrum
	- Estimations: buffer it for engineering best practices
- Optimize Daily meetings
  - Only communicate blockers. Simple status can be communicated on slack: what I did yesterday and what I'm working on today
  - Use it to share knowledge and coordinate cross platform efforts
## Time Management
- Meetings
  - Remove unnecesary meetings
  - Encourage all meetings with agenda to optimize time
- Multiply & scale your time
	- Delegate properly
	- Coach so can delegate even more
## Culture
- Vision (mobile first, ai first, cloud first companies)
- Strategy, Principles, Practices
## Inspire and Promote Engineering Culture
- Tech Blog
- Tech Talks
- Hackathons
## Innovation
- AI (Chat bot, Analytics, Recommender Systems, 3D Vision, Fraud Detection, etc)
- IoT (Wereables to improve and customize user experience)
## Product Management / Ideation

## Engineering
- Security
	- [Security engineering, applied cryptography, secure software development](https://github.com/vixentael/my-talks)
- Performance
	- JMeter scripts, postman
- Architecture & System Design
	- Scalability: Horizontal and Vertical
	- Async Task/Jobs
	- Distributed queue, Pub / Sub
	- Messaging platform (1:1, group)
- Monitoring & alerting
	- Agent vs Agentless approach
	- OpenSource vs Paid solutions
- [Chaos Engineering](https://github.com/dastergon/awesome-chaos-engineering)
- Developing best practices
	- Trunk based vs feature branches
	- Code reviews
	- Linters (smart automatic code style checker and more)
	- Danger (smart automatic code reviews)
	- Tech design (Architecture, class, interaction diagrams)
	- SonarQ (Code smells, maintainability, robustness, security, bugs, etc)
	- CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, build --> unit tests --> integration tests --> SonarQ --> build .ipa/apk --> upload to hockeyApp)
	- Postman
## Testing Best Practices
- Unit Testing
- [Unit Testing Best Practices](https://www.toptal.com/qa/how-to-write-testable-code-and-why-it-matters)

- [Tech Talk: Psychology of Testing by Misko Hevery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=pqomi6W4AJ4)
- Integrations testing
- E2E Testing
- **Level up: BDD and TDD**
	- TDD
	- BDD
		- [Applying BDD acceptance criteria in user stories](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/applying-bdd-acceptance-criteria-user-stories)
## Mobile Development
- Feature toggle
- Applanga for translation
- Mobile caching layer (Realm, Firebase, CouchMobile), BFF, GraphQL
- Native (Swift / Kotlin) vs React Native vs hybrid (Cordova)
- Charles Proxy Debugger for resilient applications
